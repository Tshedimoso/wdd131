                <p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>BTC: BTC to me is a platform that allows people and their art (whether it be fashion, music or art) be acknowledged and appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>ART: art is honestly such a beautiful concept and it's so broad and one thing about me I appreciate art and all its forms from performing art to fashion to music to any other unique forms of  art, i just love it all. 

                </p>
                
                <p>FASHION: fashion to me is a form of expression and a way for people to be truly and authentically themselves while also exploring that part of themselves</p>
