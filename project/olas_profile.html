                <h2>Ololade Omotayo-Ashafa</h2>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 21 years old</p>
                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Born in Nigeria, raised in South Africa</p>
                <p><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences (University of the Free State), Honours degree (2025)</p>
                <p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>In 2024, I began modeling for Dripenomics, a high-fashion brand that aims to create a community of creatives. This marked the beginning of my journey outside of my comfort zone, where I became more comfortable with putting myself out there. It was a transformative experience that helped me embrace confidence and self-expression.
                    Then came BTC, and I instantly fell in love with the concept when Lesedi introduced me to it. I see BTC as a powerful platform for storytelling, one that continues to evolve and expand into different forms of art, such as Threads of Resilience by O. Khule. I find it beautiful to discover the stories behind what you see, as it adds layers of meaning to the work.</p>
                    
                    <p>Being an ambassador for BTC is a meaningful recognition of my craft and an opportunity to be part of a larger community. It signifies that my work is valued, and it provides a platform for me to contribute to an incredible project alongside talented individuals. More importantly, it allows me to share my own story, connecting with others through the art we create together.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've always had a deep love for art in all its forms. After exploring different creative outlets, including poetry and visual art, I finally found my true passion in fashion, which stole my heart. However, the forms of art I am most drawn to are poetry, fashion, photography, and drawing. In the next five years, I see myself taking my craft more seriously, leveraging the potential and creativity that BTC saw in me, and reaching new heights.
                    
                    
                    To me, fashion is a form of expression and confidence. It takes a great deal of self-assurance to walk in a skirt over jeans and hold your head up high. Fashion allows me to immerse myself in my own world, where I am the canvas and my clothes are the paint. With the right combination, a beautiful story unfolds. My style can be considered versatile, but I gravitate more toward streetwear. In the coming years, I hope to experiment more with my style and explore new creative possibilities. I love how fashion can give birth to a concept and tell a story all its own.</p>
