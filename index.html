                <h2>
                    Johannesburg, South Africa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Johannesburg — fondly called Joburg, Jozi, or Egoli (the City of Gold) — is South Africa's largest city and 
                    one of Africa's most dynamic urban centers. Founded in 1886 after a gold discovery, it's one of the few major
                    cities in the world not built near a river or coast. Known for its energy and creativity, Joburg blends history,
                    culture, and modern flair — from the powerful Apartheid Museum and historic Soweto (home to Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu)
                    to the trendy Maboneng Precinct filled with art, food, and nightlife. The city is surprisingly green, boasting over 10 million trees,
                    making it one of the world's largest man-made forests. Sitting at 1,753 meters above sea level, it offers dramatic lightning-filled skies
                    and sweeping views. With over 11 official languages spoken, buzzing markets, and easy access to nearby safaris, Johannesburg truly embodies
                    the spirit of modern Africa — bold, diverse, and full of gold-tinted history
